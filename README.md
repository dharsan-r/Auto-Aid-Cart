<h1 align="center">The Auto Aid Cartü©∫</h1>

### <p align="center"> The Auto Aid Cart is an autonomous self-driving medicine cart prototype developed using C++ and built utilizing; Arduino, ultrasonic sensors, photoresistors, and servo motors.</p>

<p align="center"> The AAC was designed to automate the transport of medicne throughout a hospital to lessen the strain on nurses. The first mode allows you to control the cart manually via the D-PAD controls on your android smartphone. The second mode makes the cart autonomous  letting it go to different rooms by its self.</p>


### <h1 align="center"> Design üî®</h1>
* An Arduino parallax bot was used as the base of the cart and an enclosure was designed to hide wires and attach the sensors to.
* An ultrasonic sensor holder along was designed and screwed to securely fasten the sensors to housing.
  * Sensor holder was 3-D printed using MakerBot Replicator+
<h2> Blueprints üìê</h2>

### <h1 align="center"> Future Steps üöß</h1>
* Enlarging the entire protype and using faster DC motors for actual use.
* Using GPS sensors rather than programming specific rooms.
* Make components and breadboard more readily accessible since it is glued shut currently. With an opening the AAC would be able to get more sensors and components. 
* Adding an emergency mode which makes the cart go faster and sound an audible emergency warning so people in the hospital could move out of the way.
